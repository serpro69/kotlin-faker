# `:faker` modules

These modules contain "additional faker implementations" with fake data providers that generate domain-specific data which does not fit within the [core](../core) Faker.

They are roughly divided into the following domains:

- [books](books)
- [commerce](commerce)
- [creatures](creatures)
- [databases](databases)
- [edu](edu)
- [games](games)
- [humor](humor)
- [japmedia](japmedia)
- [lorem](lorem)
- [misc](misc)
- [movies](movies)
- [music](music)
- [sports](sports)
- [tech](tech)
- [travel](travel)
- [tvshows](tvshows)

_NB! An additional faker module like `books` or `tvshows` requires the main `kotlin-faker` dependency to be on the classpath._
