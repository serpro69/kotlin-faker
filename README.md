## About

**kotlin-faker: the ultimate fake data generation library for development and testing**

Kotlin-faker is a comprehensive data-generation library for the JVM. It is most suitable for development, testing, and data anonymization purposes, and can be used with Kotlin, Java, Android, Scala, and other JVM-based projects. Kotlin-faker provides realistic-looking, fake data generation capabilities in various domains like *names* üìá, *addresses* üè°, *internet* üåê, *banking* üí∏, *books* üìñ, *games* üéÆ, and [many more](https://serpro69.github.io/kotlin-faker/wiki/data-providers/).

In fact, kotlin-faker is so good at generating fake data, it almost fooled us into thinking it was real! üò± From names that sound like they belong to secret agents üï¥Ô∏è, to addresses where superheroes ü¶∏ might live.

---

‚ö†Ô∏è  P.S. *All names, addresses, bank accounts, and other data generated by this library - even those based on real strings - are entirely fictional.* ü¶π *All produced data is fake and generated... poorly* üí© *The data is completely made up, but the problems that it tries to solve are real* üëΩ *We take no responsibility for any existential crises caused by the eerily convincing fake data. Use with caution!* ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Prerequisites

- Faker libraries depend on java 8 and kotlin 1.9.x for runtime
- Building faker from source requires 3 jdk distributions: jdk 8 (temurin is recommended, but any vendor should work), jdk 11 (for [`docs`](docs) module) and jdk 17 (graalvm-ce distribution, for [`cli-bot`](cli-bot) module). See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.adoc) for more details.

## Installation

Latest releases are always available on maven central.

### Install with Gradle

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.serpro69:kotlin-faker:$version'
}
```  

### Install with Maven

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.github.serpro69</groupId>
        <artifactId>kotlin-faker</artifactId>
        <version>${version}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```  

***Snapshots are also available using the following repository: `https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/`***

**With gradle**
```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url = 'https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/'
    }
}
```

**With maven**
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>sonatype-snapshot</id>
        <name>Sonatype Snapshot</name>
        <url>https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

### BOM

Kotlin-faker provides a [Bill-of-Materials](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#bill-of-materials-bom-poms) that simplifies dependency management.

See [bom/README.md](bom/README.md) for more details.

### Additional Fakers

Extra fakers covering a wide range of domains are available as separate dependencies. See [faker](faker) submodules in this repo for more details about each faker.

### Third-Party Extensions

Faker provides extensions for some third-party testing libraries. See [extension](extension) submodules in this repo for more details about each extension.

## Usage

Full usage documentation for kotlin-faker is available at [serpro69.github.io/kotlin-faker/](https://serpro69.github.io/kotlin-faker/).

_NB! The documentation website is currently not versioned and always reflects `master` rather than the last stable version._

> [!WARNING]
> **kotlin-faker 2.0** is coming, which, apart from new features, also means breaking changes.
>
> More details on currently added breaking changes and migration can be found in [#220](https://github.com/serpro69/kotlin-faker/issues/220)

### Generating data

```kotlin
val faker = faker { }

faker.name.firstName() // => Ana
faker.address.city() // => New York
```

## CLI

Command line application can be used for a quick lookup of faker functions. See [faker-bot README](cli-bot/README.md)
for installation and usage details.

## Test

To run unit tests: `./gradlew clean test`

To run integration tests: `./gradlew clean integrationTest`

## Build and Deploy

To deploy to OSS Sonatype repo:

- set the following properties in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`
    - `signing.keyId=<key_id>`
    - `signing.password=<key_passphrase>`
    - `signing.secretKeyRingFile=/home/user/.gnupg/secring.gpg`
    - `sonatypeUsername=<oss_user_token>`
    - `sonatypePassword=<oss_password_token>`
    - `stagingProfileId=<oss_staging_profile_id>`
- running `publishFakerCorePublicationToSonatypeRepository` will publish the artifacts to either staging release repo or to snapshots repo, depending on the current version

### Bumping versions

Versions need to be bumped manually through a tag with the next release version that has to follow the
[semver](https://semver.org/) rules, and the tag has to be pushed to origin.

Creating the tag can be either done manually with `git tag` or by using `gradlew tag` task.

#### Pre-releases

To create a new pre-release version (new release candidate)
the following can be used: `./gradlew clean tag -Prelease -PnewPreRelease -PbumpComponent={comp}`, where `comp` can be
one of the following values: `major`, `minor`, or `patch`.

To bump an existing pre-release to the next version (next release candidate for the same release version)
the following can be used: `./gradlew clean tag -Prelease -PpreRelease`.

#### Releases

To promote a pre-release to a release version the following can be used:
`./gradlew clean tag -Prelease -PpromoteToRelease`,

To create a new release version the following can be used:
`./gradlew clean tag -Prelease -PbumpComponent={comp}`, where `comp` can be one of the following values: `major`
, `minor`, or `patch`.

#### Make targets

Alternatively to the above targets from [Makefile](Makefile) can be used for the same purposes.
